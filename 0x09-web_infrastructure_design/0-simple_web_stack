What is a server
The server (with IP address 8.8.8.8) hosts all components of the web infrastructure.

What is the role of the domain name
The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). It allows users to access the website without needing to remember the IP address.

What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
The www record in www.foobar.com is a DNS (Domain Name System) record type called a CNAME (Canonical Name). It points to the domain foobar.com, indicating that the website can be accessed with or without the www prefix.

What is the role of the web server
Nginx serves as the web server software. Its role is to handle incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers and respond with the appropriate content. It also manages static content delivery, caching, and load balancing

What is the role of the application server
The application server is where the website's codebase resides. It interprets and executes the application logic, processes dynamic content requests, interacts with the database, and generates HTML responses to be sent back to the web server.

What is the role of the database
MySQL is used as the database management system. It stores and manages the website's data, including user accounts, content, and other information. The application server communicates with the database to perform read and write operations, such as fetching user profiles or saving form submissions.

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
When a user requests the website, their computer sends an HTTP request over the internet to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). The request is received by the web server (Nginx), which forwards dynamic content requests to the application server and serves static content directly. The application server interacts with the database as needed to fulfill the request. Finally, the web server sends the generated HTML response back to the user's browser for display

Single Point of Failure (SPOF).
Since all components are hosted on a single server, any failure in hardware, software, or network connectivity could lead to downtime for the entire website.

Downtime during Maintenance
Performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or updates, may require restarting the web server or application server. During this time, the website may be temporarily unavailable to users.

Limited Scalability:
As traffic to the website increases, a single-server infrastructure may struggle to handle the load efficiently. Scaling resources such as CPU, memory, or disk I/O on a single server has limitations, leading to performance issues during peak traffic times. Additionally, scaling horizontally (adding more servers) is not feasible with this setup, limiting the ability to handle sudden spikes in traffic effectively.
